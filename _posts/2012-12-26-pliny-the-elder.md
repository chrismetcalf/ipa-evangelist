<p>Gaius Plinius Secundus better known as Pliny the Elder, was a Roman author, naturalist, and natural philosopher, as well as naval and army commander of the early Roman Empire, and personal friend of the emperor Vespasian.</p>

<p>Wait! no...</p>

<p>Pliny The Elder is an American Double Imperial IPA from Santa Rosa, California.</p>

<p>Pliny is an IPA that is one of our favorite beers to stumble across.  We usually find Pliny at our favorite california beer haunts.  And even those, don't have it reliably.</p>

<p>So when we find Pliny, we make the most of it.  While using Untappd, I always rate Pliny as a 5 star beer--I've never been disappointed.</p>
