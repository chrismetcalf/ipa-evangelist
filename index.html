<p>My name is Kin Lane.  I am an API Evangelist.  If you need more information on what an API is, header over to <a href="http://apievangelist.com" target="_blank">API Evangelist</a> for the business of APIs, <a href="http://apivoice.com" target="_blank">API Voice</a> for the politics of APIs and to actually see some APIs, head over to <a href="http://theapistack.com" target="_blank">API Stack</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the business and plitics, there is a darker, parallel universe to this fast growing API world.  A world of India Pale Ales, also known as IPAs.</p>
<p>A growing portion of individuals respondible for APIs, actually drink IPAs.</p>
<p>Mobile applications like Untappd that provide access to information about a variety of IPAs, also has an API.</p>
<p>Gatherings are popping up around the country, where people gather in pubs, drink IPAs and talk about APIs.</p>
<p>This site is dedicated to this phenomemon.  The goal is track on on individuals, specific IPAs, breweries and pubs in this space.</p>
