<p>There are very few beers I give a five star rating in Untappd.  I tend to be very liberal in rating beers with a four star, but you have to be a damn good beer to get five stars.</p>
<p>One consistently five star IPA is <a href="http://www.greenflashbrew.com/our-beers.php" target="_blank">Green Flash Brewing's West Coast IPAâ„¢</a>.  This full blown, golden IPA is the shit!</p>
<p>The West Cost IPA is usually on tap locally at Najas or Halibut corner in Redondo Beach.  So grabbing a pint or even sharing a pitcher of it regularly on the harbor is an essential.</p>
<p>Right now the only beer I'll grab over a West Coast IPA, is if they happen to have Pliny the Elder on tap--otherwise it is a Green Flash.</p>
