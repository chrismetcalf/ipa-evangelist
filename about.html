<h1>About IPA Evangelist</h1>

<p>There were just too many parallel's in my world as API Evangelist and IPAs.  I had to connect the two worlds.</p>
<p>I registered IPA Evangelist to accompany API Evangelist.</p>
<p>This may seem like a joke.  But I really, only drink IPAs and exclusively evangelize only APIs. Coincidence?</p>
<p>Who the fuck knows?  But I have to get to the bottom of it.  So I'm going to blog about IPAs alongside, APIs.<?p>
